My description of how ready I was was not accurate.  I thought I was ready
to attach the project to batteries and PCB, but miscalculated how long it
woudl take to cut and connect the wires.  One way my partner and I could
have used our time better is by finding the materials we needed earlier,
rather than when we need then.
