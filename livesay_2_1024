What I accomplished Thursday was checking that the setup for my LED cube would
function correctly to hold the LEDs. On Friday,  my partner Riele, got started
on the code we are going to need.  What I will accomplish Monday is soldering the
first 3x3 layer of LEDs and find 18 more LEDs  of the same color.  On Tuesday,
I will finish the second layer of LEDs.  I will do the third layer on
Wednesday.  On Thursday, I  will finish the setup of the hardware.  What I am 
going to accomplish Friday is to assign PINs to the LEDs.
