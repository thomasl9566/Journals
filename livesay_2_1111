What I learned about coding is that it takes time to fix a small error and it
makes you feel stupid when you finally resolve it.  I also learned that LED
cubes use bytes to light up.  I learned that prototyping process is long, but
improves the project. The transition from pictures to PCB goes from the
initial diagrams, to a final blueprint, to the first prototype, to a better
prototype, to a final product, which will be transferred to PCB.
